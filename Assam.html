<p><i>Kamakhya Devalaya is inter-mixed with oral history and legends, sometimes these soutrces reflect different periods of time. Mention of Kamakhya has been made in various ancient literatures e.g. Devi Bhagawat, Devi Purana, Kalika Purana, Yogini Tantra, Hevajra Tantra etc. The origin of the Kamakhya Temple is believed to be pre-Aryan or tribal in traits and rituals by many. But religious literature tells us that the original temple was built by Kamdev who regained his beauty here. Built with the help of Bishwakarma, this temple was believed to be a gigantic structure and probably was much bigger than the present one. It was full of beautiful architechtural and sculptural wonder. However, due to some unknown reasons, the upper portion of the temple was completely destroyed. For a long time, the temple lost its importance due to the rise of Shaivism among the rulers and the subject of what was known as Pragjyotisha Kingdom. The Kamakhya Temple’s origin are said to be pre-Aryan.</i></p>

<p><i>n the North Cachar Hill District of Assam, there is the waterfall of Panimoor which is a famous tourist spot. Situated about 120 km away from Haflong, the Kopili River is obstructed by stones, but yet it turns into a gushing milky white waterfall at this spot called Panimur and is indeed an ethereal beauty. The panoramic view of the scenery attracts a number of nature lovers and photographers into this place. There is a Forest Inspection Bungalow in this place, which can house a few tourists but needs to be booked in advance, especially in the tourist season. Panimoor is the only hill station of the district, and thus, favoured by a number of tourists, especially during winter and spring. The Panimur fall also causes flood in the lower lands during the monsoons.</p></i>

<h1 ><b>KAZIRANGA NATIONAL PARK</b></h1>
<img src="ASSAM2.jpg">
<p><i>As you amble across the tall grasslands on elephant back and emerge into an opening, you’re likely to run into some heavily armoured, prehistoric looking one- horned rhinoceros, nonchalantly grazing before you barely looking up to give you the time of day. Do consider the sight that belies the extraordinary story behind their survival, here on the banks of the mighty Brahmaputra River. This 430 square kilometres of swamps, sandy riverine islands and waves of tall elephant grass which exist over a flat and broad plain, interspersed with forests of moist tropical trees, floods dramatically ever year and is key to its semi aquatic existence. A World Heritage Site, the park today hosts two-thirds of the world’s greater one-horned rhinoceros, according to the latest census in March 2015 a total of 2,401 - a remarkable feat considering the species was on the verge of extinction, with only 12 left in 1903. In 1908, Kaziranga was designated a Reserve Forest with pioneering protection efforts underway, before being given official park status in 1974. Within these watery borders remain herds of now endangered wild buffalo, Asian elephant, swamp deer, capped langur and Asia’s only ape - the hoolock gibbon, which lives in the canopies of the higher bordering forests of Karbi Anglong. It’s also one of India densest tiger habitats with recent estimations of over 80 individuals - but you will be lucky to spot them. Keep binoculars at the ready for this is rare Bengal florican country and a host of wetland and migrant bird species, specifically in the winter months can be enjoyed on elephant back, from a watchtower, by jeep, or in some parts, on foot with an experienced guide. The park has three tourism zones - Kohora, Bagora and Agartoli.</i></p>
