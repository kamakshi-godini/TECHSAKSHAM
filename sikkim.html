<p><i>The sheer brilliance of natural beauty is reason enough to visit the Tsomgo Lake. Majestic silver firs and pine trees skirt the gorgeous glacial lake that is almost a kilometer long. Changing seasons bring new colours to the lake waters, from sapphire blue in spring time to a dark inky green as winter approaches. Monsoons bring mists that shroud the lake adding to its mysterious aura. Springtime ushers in a riot of colours to the pristine surroundings of the lake with a variety of flowers. The area is resplendent with birdlife; rose finches, yellow-bellied fantail flycatchers, golden eagles and a host of migratory birds such as tufted pochards, brown-headed gulls and the famed brahminy ducks. Animals even though present are rather elusive. However, if you’re lucky you might spot musk deers, gorals or red pandas in the higher range of Tsomgo. There are records of leopard and Himalayan black bear sightings too.</i></p>
