<p><i>"White sheets of still water under a half moonlight A land lain undisturbed for much of history, Visited in the past of an eerie knowingness, A discipline demanding sacrifice of all, A beneficent place where the seeker may Iive off the bounty of earth, Find perpetual warmth on southern shores, perpetual cold in the north."

Taj Mahal is one of the Seven Wonders of the World. It is situated on the bank of river Yamuna in the city of Agra (India). Taj is a symbol of the great Mughal heritage of India and of the eternity of love. Experiencing The Taj Mahal is like a journey back to the magnificent Mughal Empire. This monument is simply the expression of emotions in a structural form, and so, it is regarded as a monument of love. So, it's a place worth visiting to memorize the love in your life. Mughal emperor Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal monument in 1631 as a tribute to his loving wife, Mumtaz Mahal.</i></p>
