<img src="iskton.jpg">
<p><i> One of the must-see sites in Tirupati, the ISKON temple is a beautiful temple dedicated to Lord Krishna. The temple is known for its location and edifice. The construction of this magnificent temple initiated in the year 1997. The breathtaking beauty of the Radhe-Krishna deity is the highlight of the temple. The deity is always decorated with flowers, garlands and beautiful attires. The temple ambience is filled with chants of ‘hare Krishna hare Rama, Rama Rama hare hare’ all day through. The temple premise also houses various sculptures and drawings, which depict the different time-periods from the era of Lord Krishna. The Goshala is another important aspect of the ISKON temple in Tirupati. It is a home to many cows and oxen. The Goshala is located just behind the temple complex and has over 100 Healthy cattle. Unlike other traditional temples, the ISKON premise is very neat and clean and well maintained.</i></p>

<h1 ><b>JAGANNATH TEMPLE</b></h1>
<img src="jaganadha temple.jpg">
<p><i>Odisha is known as the land of Lord Jagannath (literally meaning the Lord of the Universe). The temple built in the 12th Century AD has been the epicenter of Jagannath cult and sees pilgrims flocking the temple town of Puri from all corners of the world throughout the year.

The mysticism associated with the cult of Lord Jagannath overshadows the architectural brilliance of this magnificent temple.  Built on a raised platform, the gigantic temple is an architectural marvel in its own right.

The temple saw new additions to its structure till about the 16th Century AD. Unlike other temples of the region, the carvings on the temples are predominantly of gods and goddesses. The entire temple complex is enclosed within two concentric walls, the Kuruma Bheda (Inner wall) and the Meghnad Pachira (Wall). The main entrance to the temple is through Singhadwara located on the Eastern front of the temple with three other entrances along the four cardinal directions. However these are not architecturally aligned indicating that the other entrances might have been created for security purposes since the temple was at the eye of the storm during the tumultuous period between 16th and 18th century.</i></p>

<h1 ><b>NEERMAHAL PALACE</b></h1>
<img src="neermahal.jpg">
<p><i>Neermahal, the water palace, is located at the centre of Rudrasagar lake; almost 2 hours journey from capital of Tripura, Agartala. Tourists can hire private vehicle from Agaratala, or else public transport is also available through nearby Melaghar town.

Conceptually Neermahal is quite unique, most probably the only one in Eastern India; beautiful white coloured palace amidst a large lake (area more than 5 sq. km.). The palace is connected with boat service. Neermahal was used as summer residence for the royal family of Tripura. There are separate sections within the palace, connected with corridors. Travelers can imagine, in rainy days the entire palace would look like floating. It has been a very joyful experience to visit the place. There is also a tourist lodge in the mainland (maintained and operated by Tourism department, Govt. of Tripura) if anybody wants to stay. There is metal lighting arrangement, and the entire property looks fascinating in night. Though a wonderful property, it needs further care and treatment from the Govt. More maintenance is required, specially the lake must be clean, making it free from floating plants, which kills the overall view to great extent. Serious travelers would also expect any sort of museum which is not there; only few sign boards could not be a any substitute. Also there is lack of proper guides, tavelers have to rely on few enthusiastic locals only. If properly emphasized by state tourism to make it attractive, then it could be a very popular destination, at least to some extent when comparing Jalmahal of Rajasthan.</p></i>
